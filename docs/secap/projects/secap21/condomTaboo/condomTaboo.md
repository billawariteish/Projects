### Problem Statement:

Condoms are treated as a taboo in Metropolitan India, deterring young people from using contraception. This taboo has resulted in a social stigma surrounding condom use. Whilst the majority of young men in India are aware of the use and benefits of condoms, they are deterred from using them as they diminish feelings of masculinity, there is a lack of privacy, and individuals feel embarrassed purchasing them in their community. These socio-cultural norms prevent young males from purchasing and using condoms.

#### Who is this affecting:
Although this is affecting a huge majority, our focus will be towards the students in O. P. Jindal University in India, where we can implement the solution and work on the feedback.




### Final Solutions:
1. Open house at O.P. Jindal (one male session and one mixed session)
Jar (tree) with condoms with questions
   *  Gather people in open house and first person gets a condom with a question
   * If they answer correctly then they get to keep the condom, if not it gets passed to the next person and continues until someone gets it right 
   * Jars of condoms with questions are available to buy (other university groups might be interested)

2. Buy wholesale condoms to sell at open house  
Use profit to reinvest in business and buy new condoms for next open house 

3. Have website to sell jars and boxes of condoms
