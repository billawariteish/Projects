## Guardian

### Abstract:
Guardian Enterprise is an organisation that specialises in providing anti-sexual harassment and sexual harassment awareness training for female Delhi bus conductors. As a third party organisation aimed precisely at addressing womens’ safety on public buses, we are able to ensure that women are positioned at the forefront of combating harassment, and instill a sense of pride and legitimacy in the female bus conductor role - and by extension the role of women in public life.

### SDG in Focus: ***Gender Equality***

### Problem Statement:
In metropolitan Indian cities, female tertiary students (generally between 17-23 y/o/a)  in particular endure high levels of sexual harassment on public transport - public buses more specifically (Tripathi, Borion & Belur 2017). This is a dangerous perpetuation of discrimination against women, and contravenes the targets of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.

### Who is this affecting:
Female Students in the age between 17 and 23 in Delhi region.

### Solution Brainstorming (Narrowed down):
1. Embedded tracking in ‘bus card’ to disincentivise lawlessness (send location, notify emergency services/close contacts). (prototype: app)  
2. Female-oriented rideshare services. (prototype: app)
Cost
Environmental consideration
High traffic concentration
3. Self-defense education in tertiary institutions. (prototype: curriculum/campaign)
Strength of correlation to issue
4. Dividers under seating to prevent man-spreading/sexual harassment ‘from below’ .(curtains/barriers between seats). (prototype: model/product)

5. An application with few features to safeguard women.
    * QR code to record the travel details
    * Smart lightning
    * Smart alarms in buses


### Solution Finalisation
**Guardian Enterprise** is an organisation that specialises in providing anti-sexual harassment and sexual harassment awareness training for female Delhi bus conductors. As a third party organisation aimed precisely at addressing womens’ safety on public buses, we are able to ensure that women are positioned at the forefront of combating harassment, and instill a sense of pride and legitimacy in the female bus conductor role - and by extension the role of women in public life.
